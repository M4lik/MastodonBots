# WaitingForC3

A small Mastodon bot created by me.

The bot is currently active [over here](https://botsin.space/@waitingforC3).

Frequent execution of the bot is done via a cron job, 12.00 each day

## ToDo

- [ ] Add multiple announcement texts for "regular" days until c3 event
- [ ] Add multiple texts for days during c3
